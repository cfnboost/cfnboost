/**
 * With the `DeletionPolicy` attribute you can preserve, and in some cases,
 * backup a resource when its stack is deleted. You specify a `DeletionPolicy`
 * attribute for each resource that you want to control. If a resource has no
 * `DeletionPolicy` attribute, AWS CloudFormation deletes the resource by
 * default, except for:
 *
 *  - For `AWS::RDS::DBCluster resources`, the default policy is `Snapshot`.
 *  - For `AWS::RDS::DBInstance` resources that don't specify the
 *    `DBClusterIdentifier` property, the default policy is `Snapshot`.
 *  - For Amazon S3 buckets, you must delete all objects in the bucket for
 *    deletion to succeed.
 *
 * This capability also applies to stack update operations that lead to
 * resources being deleted from stacks. For example, if you remove the resource
 * from the stack template, and then update the stack with the template. This
 * capability doesn't apply to resources whose physical instance is replaced
 * during stack update operations. For example, if you edit a resource's
 * properties such that CloudFormation replaces that resource during a stack
 * update.
 *
 * To keep a resource when its stack is deleted, specify Retain for that
 * resource. You can use retain for any resource. For example, you can retain a
 * nested stack, Amazon S3 bucket, or EC2 instance so that you can continue to
 * use or modify those resources after you delete their stacks.
 *
 * For resources that support snapshots, such as `AWS::EC2::Volume`, specify
 * Snapshot to have CloudFormation create a snapshot before deleting the
 * resource.
