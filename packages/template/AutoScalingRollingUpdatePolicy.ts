/**
 * To specify how CloudFormation handles rolling updates for an Auto Scaling
 * group, use the `AutoScalingRollingUpdate` policy. Rolling updates enable you
 * to specify whether AWS CloudFormation updates instances that are in an Auto
 * Scaling group in batches or all at once.
 *
 * Be aware that, during stack update rollback operations, CloudFormation uses
 * the `UpdatePolicy` configuration specified in the template before the current
 * stack update operation. For example, suppose you have updated the
 * `MaxBatchSize` in your stack template's `UpdatePolicy` from 1 to 10. You then
 * perform a stack update, and that update fails and CloudFormation initiates an
 * update rollback operation. In such a case, CloudFormation will use 1 as the
 * maximum batch size, rather than 10. For this reason, we recommend you make
 * changes to the UpdatePolicy configuration in a stack update separate from and
 * before any updates to the `AWS::AutoScaling::AutoScalingGroup` resource that
 * are likely to initiate rolling updates.
 *
 * @see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-attribute-updatepolicy.html#cfn-attributes-updatepolicy-rollingupdate
